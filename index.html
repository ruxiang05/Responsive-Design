       Because sometimes you just need to travel through some time.

       <h2>Using Wormholes</h2>

       <p>
         There is no observational evidence for wormholes, but on a theoretical level there are valid solutions
         to the equations of the theory of general relativity which contain wormholes. Because of its robust
         theoretical strength, a wormhole is also known as one of the great physics metaphors for teaching general relativity.

         <h2>Time Dilation</h2>
         <p>Time dilation is permitted by Albert Einstein's special and general theories of relativity. These theories state that, relative to a given observer, time passes more slowly for bodies moving quickly relative to that observer, or bodies that are deeper within a gravity well.

         <h2>Parallel Universes</h2>
         <p>The many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction, but denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse. Many-worlds implies that all possible alternative histories and futures are real, each representing an actual "world" (or "universe").
